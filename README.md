## ðŸ“‹ How It Works
1. Two objects, `person1` and `person2`, are created with the following properties:
   - `firstName`: The first name of the person.
   - `lastName`: The last name of the person.
   - `age`: The age of the person.
   - `isEmployed`: A boolean indicating employment status.

2. Methods are added to each object:
   - `sayHello`: Logs a greeting message to the console.
   - `eat`: Logs what the person is eating.

3. The properties and methods of the objects are logged using `console.log`.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Carlosmarroquin20/Objects-in-JS-Basics.git
   cd Objects-in-JS-Basics
   ```

2. Open the `index.js` file in any code editor.

3. Run the file in Node.js to see the output:
